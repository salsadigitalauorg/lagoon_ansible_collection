description: A collection to interact with the Lagoon API

# Either a single license or a list of licenses for content inside of a collection. Ansible Galaxy currently only
# accepts L(SPDX,https://spdx.org/licenses/) licenses. This key is mutually exclusive with 'license_file'

# A list of tags you want to associate with the collection for indexing/searching. A tag name has the same character
# requirements as 'namespace' and 'name'
tags: []

# Collections that this collection requires to be installed for it to be usable. The key of the dict is the
# collection label 'namespace.name'. The value is a version range
# L(specifiers,https://python-semanticversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#requirement-specification). Multiple version
# range specifiers can be set and are separated by ','
dependencies: {}

# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories that should not be included in the build
# artifact. A pattern is matched from the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This
# uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry',
# and '.git' are always filtered
